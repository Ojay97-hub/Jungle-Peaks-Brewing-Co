### Automated 

## Bugs 

### Quantity btns were going up by 2 instead of 1:
How to Fix It
Remove the Duplicate Binding:
Decide whether you want to use the inline JavaScript or the jQuery approach. If you choose jQuery, remove the inline onclick attributes and adjust the button classes so that only one set of event listeners applies.

Ensure Unique Class Names:
Make sure the buttons don’t have both sets of classes (e.g., avoid having both increase-btn and increment-qty on the same element) to prevent multiple handlers from firing. 


###  Fixing the Blue Highlight Around the Account Dropdown on Mobile (Heroku Deployment)
The blue highlight appears because browsers apply a default outline on focusable elements, like your <a> tag inside the dropdown. This is especially noticeable on mobile devices, where tapping an element triggers the focus state.

✅ Solution: Remove Focus Outline for Clicked Dropdown:

Remove the blue focus outline from .user-icon when clicked.
Ensure accessibility by keeping focus for keyboard navigation.
Apply outline: none; but only when using a mouse/touch.


### 🔍 Bug: Update Button Not Submitting the Form

Problem:
When clicking the "Update" button, the shopping bag quantity did not update. Instead, it only visually changed the number inside the input field but did not submit the form to update the session data.

Root Causes:
Incorrect .update-link Selector:

The jQuery selector was not correctly finding the form related to the specific product.
The previous code targeted .product-details, .quantity-container, but in desktop view, these containers are not always present. The correct form might be inside a <td> (table cell) element.
+ and - Buttons Were Working but Not Updating the Bag:

Clicking + or - correctly changed the quantity, but since the update-form was not automatically submitted, the actual cart in the session was not updated.
Event Listeners Might Not Be Binding Correctly:

If .update-link could not find the correct form, .submit() was not being called properly.
✅ Solution: Ensuring the Correct Form is Submitted
Fix .update-link to Target the Correct Form:

Instead of just searching inside .product-details or .quantity-container, we added td (table cell) as another possible container.
This makes sure that whether the view is mobile or desktop, the correct update-form is found and submitted.
Prevent + and - from Auto-Updating the Cart:

Previously, clicking + or - changed the number but did not trigger a session update.
We prevented automatic updates and ensured the session updates only when the user clicks "Update".
Fixed Form Submission Logic:

Now, when "Update" is clicked, it finds the nearest <td> or .product-details container that contains .update-form and correctly submits it.
