### E-commerce Business Model 
### Facebook
### Newsletter 
### SEO Content

## Robots.txt & Sitemap.xml
This project features both a robots.txt and sitemap.xml files for reasons outlined below:

### **robots.txt**
The `robots.txt` file is used to guide search engine crawlers on which pages or sections of the site they are allowed to index. It helps manage the crawling process to prevent unnecessary indexing of admin pages, private areas, or duplicate content.

- Allows search engines to crawl essential pages.
- Blocks access to sensitive areas (e.g., admin panel).
- Helps optimize crawl budget for better SEO.

### **sitemap.xml**
The `sitemap.xml` file is an essential component for SEO, as it provides search engines with a structured list of all important pages on the website. This ensures that pages are efficiently indexed and helps improve discoverability.

- Lists URLs for search engines to crawl efficiently.
- Includes metadata like last modified dates to prioritize updates.
- Improves site visibility and indexing speed for search engines.

Both files are crucial for **SEO optimisation** and ensuring that the **website structure is efficiently navigated by search engines**.

✅ **All tests passed successfully, ensuring checkout functionality is working as expected.**

This Django test suite ensures that the checkout process functions correctly, covering order creation, payment processing, and error handling. All tests have **passed successfully** ✅.

## 📌 What was Tested
The test suite includes various unit tests to validate the checkout functionality:

### 🔹 Checkout Page Loads Properly
- Ensures the checkout page renders correctly with the correct template.
- Uses `mock_stripe_create` to simulate Stripe PaymentIntent creation.

### 🔹 Caching Checkout Data
- Tests if checkout data is successfully cached in Stripe's PaymentIntent.
- Uses `mock_stripe_modify` to mock the Stripe API.

### 🔹 Order Creation
- Verifies that submitting the checkout form correctly creates an order.
- Ensures the order contains the correct customer details and products.

### 🔹 Handling Empty Cart Checkout
- Ensures users **cannot proceed to checkout** with an empty cart.
- Confirms redirection back to the products page with an appropriate message.

### 🔹 Checkout Success Page
- Verifies that the order success page displays correctly after a successful checkout.

- Simulates a scenario where a product in the cart does not exist.
- Ensures the user is redirected back to their shopping bag with an error message.

## 📊 Test Results
✅ **All tests passed successfully**, confirming that the checkout process works as expected.

## 🐛 Bugs  

### 🛠️ **Bug: Quantity Buttons Incrementing by 2 Instead of 1**  
**Issue:**  
- The quantity increment and decrement buttons were increasing/decreasing by **2 instead of 1**.  

**Root Cause:**  
- Duplicate event binding: Both inline JavaScript (`onclick`) and jQuery were handling the click event, causing it to fire twice.  

**✅ Solution:**  
1. **Remove the Duplicate Binding:**  
   - Choose **either** inline JavaScript **or** jQuery to handle the event.  
   - If using jQuery, remove the inline `onclick` attributes to prevent duplicate handlers.  

2. **Ensure Unique Class Names:**  
   - Avoid using multiple conflicting classes on the same element (e.g., `increase-btn` and `increment-qty` together).  
   - This prevents multiple handlers from triggering on a single click.

### 🎨 **Bug: Blue Highlight Around Account Dropdown on Mobile (Heroku Deployment)**  
**Issue:**  
- When tapping the account dropdown on **mobile devices**, a **blue highlight** appeared due to the browser’s default `outline` behavior for focusable elements (`<a>` tags).  

**✅ Solution:**  
1. **Remove Focus Outline on Click:**  
   - Apply `outline: none;` but **only when using a mouse/touch**, ensuring accessibility for keyboard users.  
   - Example CSS Fix:  
     ```css
     .user-icon:focus {
         outline: none;
     }
     ```  
2. **Maintain Accessibility:**  
   - While removing the outline for mouse/touch users, keep it for keyboard navigation to comply with accessibility best practices.

### 🔄 **Bug: Update Button Not Submitting the Form**  
**Issue:**  
- Clicking the **"Update"** button in the shopping bag visually changed the quantity but **did not submit the form**, meaning the session data was **not updated**.  

**Root Causes:**  
1. **Incorrect `.update-link` Selector:**  
   - The jQuery selector was not correctly identifying the form associated with each product.  
   - The previous code targeted `.product-details` and `.quantity-container`, which are **not always present** in **desktop view**.  

2. **Quantity (`+` and `-`) Buttons Were Updating Visually, But Not Updating the Session:**  
   - Clicking the buttons **changed the number in the input field** but **did not submit the form**, so the cart was not updated in the session.  

3. **Event Listeners Not Binding Correctly:**  
   - If `.update-link` could not find the correct form, `.submit()` was **not being triggered** properly.  

**✅ Solution:**  
1. **Fix `.update-link` to Target the Correct Form:**  
   - Updated the selector to **look inside `<td>` (table cell)** as another possible container.  
   - This ensures that, whether in **mobile** or **desktop** view, the correct `.update-form` is found and submitted.  

2. **Prevent `+` and `-` Buttons from Automatically Updating the Cart:**  
   - Previously, clicking `+` or `-` changed the value in the input field but **did not trigger a session update**.  
   - Now, the session updates **only when the user clicks "Update"**.  

3. **Fix Form Submission Logic:**  
   - Ensured that clicking "Update" correctly **finds the nearest `<td>` or `.product-details` container** and submits the **correct form**.

✅ **All these bugs have been identified and fixed, improving the checkout and shopping experience.** 🎉  
## Deployment

This project was deployed on heroku - the steps to do so are number below:

### Heroku

#### Step 1: Create a Heroku app

1. Go to your Heroku app dashboard > Settings > Config Vars. Add:
   - Key: `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC`
   - Value: `1`  
   _(Static files will be handled later.)_

   ```bash
   # Create a Heroku app and set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC
   heroku create your-app-name
   heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1

#### Step 2: Update your code for deployment 
1.	Install the required dependencies and update requirements.txt:

        pip install gunicorn django-heroku whitenoise psycopg2-binary
        pip freeze > requirements.txt

    - the requirements.txt tells heroku what version to run the app at. 
    - This ensures heroku has the correct packages during deployment.
    
```bash
echo "web: gunicorn event_scheduler.wsgi" > Procfile
```

- Update your settings debug == **false**

- Add .herokuapp.com to ALLOWED_HOSTS: 

```bash
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-app-name.herokuapp.com', '.herokuapp.com']
```

- Add whitenoise to static files  

```bash
django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware 
whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware
```

- Static file configs: 
```bash
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles') 
STATIC_URL = '/static/' 
STATICFILES_STORAGE = "whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage"
  ```

- Push changes to github via commit.
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare app for Heroku deployment"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 3: Deploy to heroku

1.	Connect Heroku to your GitHub repository:

    Go to the Heroku dashboard > Deploy tab.
    Select “GitHub” as the deployment method and connect your repository.

2.	Deploy the main branch:

    Scroll to the “Manual deploy” section.
    Select the main branch and click “Deploy Branch.”

3.	Monitor activity logs to ensure a successful deployment.

#### Step 4: Post-deployment

1.	Connect to your PostgreSQL database:
	•	Add the DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY to env.py:

```bash
import os
os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "your-database-url"
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your-secret-key"
```

be sure to add env.py to gitignore

2.	Update settings.py to use dj_database_url:

```bash
import dj_database_url

DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}
```

3.	Add DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY to Heroku Config Vars via the dashboard.
4.	Run database migrations and create a superuser:

- Run your database migrations "python manage.py makemigrations" "python manage.py migrate" 

- create superuser for admin access "python manage.py createsuperuser"

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

- You need to then collectstatic:
    - remove DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC config var > then run in terminal 
    
```bash
    "python manage.py collectstatic"
```

- You should be able to then deploy your heroku app with your database connected and begin production.
