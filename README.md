| `test_checkout_redirects_when_bag_is_empty` | Ensures checkout redirects when the shopping bag is empty.           | Redirects to `products` with a message.                  |
| `test_checkout_success_view`                | Verifies successful checkout page loads correctly.                   | Order confirmation page displays order details.          |
| `test_checkout_fails_for_invalid_product`   | Tests checkout failure when a product in the bag does not exist.     | Redirects to `view_bag` with an error message.           |

‚úÖ **All tests passed successfully, ensuring checkout functionality is working as expected.**

This Django test suite ensures that the checkout process functions correctly, covering order creation, payment processing, and error handling. All tests have **passed successfully** ‚úÖ.

## üìå What was Tested
The test suite includes various unit tests to validate the checkout functionality:

### üîπ Checkout Page Loads Properly
- Ensures the checkout page renders correctly with the correct template.
- Uses `mock_stripe_create` to simulate Stripe PaymentIntent creation.

### üîπ Caching Checkout Data
- Tests if checkout data is successfully cached in Stripe's PaymentIntent.
- Uses `mock_stripe_modify` to mock the Stripe API.

### üîπ Order Creation
- Verifies that submitting the checkout form correctly creates an order.
- Ensures the order contains the correct customer details and products.

### üîπ Handling Empty Cart Checkout
- Ensures users **cannot proceed to checkout** with an empty cart.
- Confirms redirection back to the products page with an appropriate message.

### üîπ Checkout Success Page
- Verifies that the order success page displays correctly after a successful checkout.

### üîπ Handling Missing Products
- Simulates a scenario where a product in the cart does not exist.
- Ensures the user is redirected back to their shopping bag with an error message.

## üìä Test Results
‚úÖ **All tests passed successfully**, confirming that the checkout process works as expected.

## üêõ Bugs  

### üõ†Ô∏è **Bug: Quantity Buttons Incrementing by 2 Instead of 1**  
**Issue:**  
- The quantity increment and decrement buttons were increasing/decreasing by **2 instead of 1**.  

**Root Cause:**  
- Duplicate event binding: Both inline JavaScript (`onclick`) and jQuery were handling the click event, causing it to fire twice.  

**‚úÖ Solution:**  
1. **Remove the Duplicate Binding:**  
   - Choose **either** inline JavaScript **or** jQuery to handle the event.  
   - If using jQuery, remove the inline `onclick` attributes to prevent duplicate handlers.  

2. **Ensure Unique Class Names:**  
   - Avoid using multiple conflicting classes on the same element (e.g., `increase-btn` and `increment-qty` together).  
   - This prevents multiple handlers from triggering on a single click.  

---

### üé® **Bug: Blue Highlight Around Account Dropdown on Mobile (Heroku Deployment)**  
**Issue:**  
- When tapping the account dropdown on **mobile devices**, a **blue highlight** appeared due to the browser‚Äôs default `outline` behavior for focusable elements (`<a>` tags).  

**‚úÖ Solution:**  
1. **Remove Focus Outline on Click:**  
   - Apply `outline: none;` but **only when using a mouse/touch**, ensuring accessibility for keyboard users.  
   - Example CSS Fix:  
     ```css
     .user-icon:focus {
         outline: none;
     }
     ```  
2. **Maintain Accessibility:**  
   - While removing the outline for mouse/touch users, keep it for keyboard navigation to comply with accessibility best practices.  

---

### üîÑ **Bug: Update Button Not Submitting the Form**  
**Issue:**  
- Clicking the **"Update"** button in the shopping bag visually changed the quantity but **did not submit the form**, meaning the session data was **not updated**.  

**Root Causes:**  
1. **Incorrect `.update-link` Selector:**  
   - The jQuery selector was not correctly identifying the form associated with each product.  
   - The previous code targeted `.product-details` and `.quantity-container`, which are **not always present** in **desktop view**.  

2. **Quantity (`+` and `-`) Buttons Were Updating Visually, But Not Updating the Session:**  
   - Clicking the buttons **changed the number in the input field** but **did not submit the form**, so the cart was not updated in the session.  

3. **Event Listeners Not Binding Correctly:**  
   - If `.update-link` could not find the correct form, `.submit()` was **not being triggered** properly.  

**‚úÖ Solution:**  
1. **Fix `.update-link` to Target the Correct Form:**  
   - Updated the selector to **look inside `<td>` (table cell)** as another possible container.  
   - This ensures that, whether in **mobile** or **desktop** view, the correct `.update-form` is found and submitted.  

2. **Prevent `+` and `-` Buttons from Automatically Updating the Cart:**  
   - Previously, clicking `+` or `-` changed the value in the input field but **did not trigger a session update**.  
   - Now, the session updates **only when the user clicks "Update"**.  

3. **Fix Form Submission Logic:**  
   - Ensured that clicking "Update" correctly **finds the nearest `<td>` or `.product-details` container** and submits the **correct form**.

‚úÖ **All these bugs have been identified and fixed, improving the checkout and shopping experience.** üéâ  
## Deployment

### üöÄ Cloning this GitHub Repository to VS Code  
To deploy my **Jungle Peaks Brewing** project, you need to **clone the GitHub repository into VS Code** and set it up for development.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Open VS Code & Clone Repository**
1. Open **VS Code**.
2. Open the **Terminal** (press `Ctrl + ~` or navigate to `View > Terminal`).
3. Run the following command to clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ojay97-hub/Jungle-Peaks-Brewing-Co

--- 

This project was deployed on heroku - the steps to do so are number below:

### Heroku

#### Step 1: Create a Heroku app

1. Go to your Heroku app dashboard > Settings > Config Vars. Add:
   - Key: `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC`
   - Value: `1`  
   _(Static files will be handled later.)_

   ```bash
   # Create a Heroku app and set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC
   heroku create your-app-name
   heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1

#### Step 2: Update your code for deployment 
1.	Install the required dependencies and update requirements.txt:

        pip install gunicorn django-heroku whitenoise psycopg2-binary
        pip freeze > requirements.txt

    - the requirements.txt tells heroku what version to run the app at. 
    - This ensures heroku has the correct packages during deployment.
    
```bash
echo "web: gunicorn event_scheduler.wsgi" > Procfile
```

- Update your settings debug == **false**

- Add .herokuapp.com to ALLOWED_HOSTS: 

```bash
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-app-name.herokuapp.com', '.herokuapp.com']
```

- Add whitenoise to static files  

```bash
django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware 
whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware
```

- Static file configs: 
```bash
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles') 
STATIC_URL = '/static/' 
STATICFILES_STORAGE = "whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage"
  ```

- Push changes to github via commit.
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare app for Heroku deployment"
git push origin main
```

#### Step 3: Deploy to heroku

1.	Connect Heroku to your GitHub repository:

    Go to the Heroku dashboard > Deploy tab.
    Select ‚ÄúGitHub‚Äù as the deployment method and connect your repository.

2.	Deploy the main branch:

    Scroll to the ‚ÄúManual deploy‚Äù section.
    Select the main branch and click ‚ÄúDeploy Branch.‚Äù

3.	Monitor activity logs to ensure a successful deployment.

#### Step 4: Post-deployment

1.	Connect to your PostgreSQL database:
	‚Ä¢	Add the DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY to env.py:

```bash
import os
os.environ["DATABASE_URL"] = "your-database-url"
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "your-secret-key"
```

be sure to add env.py to gitignore

2.	Update settings.py to use dj_database_url:

```bash
import dj_database_url

DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}
```

3.	Add DATABASE_URL and SECRET_KEY to Heroku Config Vars via the dashboard.
4.	Run database migrations and create a superuser:

- Run your database migrations "python manage.py makemigrations" "python manage.py migrate" 

- create superuser for admin access "python manage.py createsuperuser"

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

- You need to then collectstatic:
    - remove DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC config var > then run in terminal 
    
```bash
    "python manage.py collectstatic"
```

- You should be able to then deploy your heroku app with your database connected and begin production. 

#### Heroku Config Vars

The following environment variables were applied to Heroku:
